This is a slover for terry's ring game found here https://github.com/michaelpetersubc/notebooks/blob/master/Econ515/ring_game/ring_game.ipynb
It starts with a random player (the cellphone player) profile and builds the action profile  of each level player as terry describes, except 
the subgame perfect player
